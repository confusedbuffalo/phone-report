# OpenStreetMap Phone Number Validator

This project generates a static website that reports invalid phone numbers from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. The goal is to identify and provide an easy way to fix incorrect phone number data in OSM.

The generated site is available at https://confusedbuffalo.github.io/phone-report/ and the data there is usually updated once per day.

## How it works

The project fetches data from OSM, validates phone numbers, and generates a static HTML report. The process is as follows:

1.  **Fetch Data**: For each country and its subdivisions defined in `src/data/constants.js`, the project queries the Overpass API to fetch OSM elements with phone number tags.
2.  **Validate Numbers**: The fetched phone numbers are validated using `libphonenumber-js`. Numbers are checked for correct formatting and validity for the specific country.
3.  **Generate Reports**: The results are compiled into HTML reports. A main index page lists all countries, each linking to a country-specific page. The country page, in turn, lists reports for its subdivisions. Each subdivision report details the invalid phone numbers, providing direct links to edit the data in various OSM editors (iD, JOSM, etc.).

## How to add a new country

To add a new country to the report, you need to modify [countries.json](/src/data/countries.json). Follow these steps:

1.  **Add a new entry** to the [countries.json](/src/data/countries.json) file. You will need to provide:
    *   `name`: The name of the country.
    *   `countryCode`: The two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.
    *   `locale`: The locale for formatting and language of the generated pages.
    *   `divisions` or `divisionMap`:
        *   Use `divisions` to specify a map of division names to their OSM relation IDs
            *  If there is another depth of division, provide `subdivisionAdminLevel` to fetch subdivisions automatically (like France).
            *  If not then omit that key (like Belgium)
        *   Use `divisionMap` for a hardcoded list of divisions and subdivisions.

2.  **Add translations** (optional): If the country uses a language not already present, add a new JSON file in the `locales/` directory (e.g., `de-DE.json` for German).

## How to run

To run the project locally and generate the reports, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://confusedbuffalo.github.io/phone-report/
    cd osm-phones
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the build script:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will generate the static site in the `public/` directory.

4.  **Run in test mode:**
    To do a quicker, simplified build for testing purposes, run:
    ```bash
    BUILD_TYPE=simplified npm start
    ```
    This will only process one subdivision for one division for one country, which is much faster than a full build.
